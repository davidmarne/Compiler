<h1>Semantic Analyzer Commentary</h1>
<h3 class="centered">By Dominic Frost</h3>

<h2>Purpose of the Semantic Analyzer</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Symatic Analyzer is to generate low level code (i.e assembly code) based upon the tokens we are reading and the location on the parse tree that the token exits. We also take the time to ensure that the code we are given is symantically correct. For example, we want to make sure that the types of two different variables we are adding together are compatible, (able to be cast to a common type if they are not the same). We don't want to allow the user to be able to add an integer to a boolean value.  </p>

<h2>Stack-Based Code Generation</h2>
<p>Arithmatic is very easy to visualize with a stack based approach. To add two values using stack-based-arithmatic, you push each value onto the stack, then call add stack. This will pop the two values off the top of the stack and run them through an adder, and then push the resulting value back onto the stack. It gets a little more difficult to understand when you are subtracting or dividing, and the order you push values onto the stack matters. However, as long as you keep the order you push things onto the stack consistant, it shouldn't be a problem. For example, 9/3 would push 9 and 3 onto the stack. In this case, the first value pushed will be the numerator, and the second will be the denominator. As long as the virtual machine that is executing the generated code knows that the bottom value of the stack is the numerator and the top value is the denominator, it can divide the values properly, and push the quotient onto the stack.</p>

<h2>Runtime Memory Model</h2>
<p>Whenever we set up a new runtime memory model, there are a few things that we need to do. <br><br>1. We store whatever value exists in the D-register on the stack, so we can pop it off later when we are tearing down to memory model, and leave the register in the same state that we found it. <br><br>2.We push the stack pointer into the D-register so we had a reference to the current memory model. <br><br>3. We increase the stack pointer by howerver many spaces on the stack we need to store local variables. This way we have space to store all the values we need without messing up the stack, which we will use later for arithmatic and comparisons. <br><br> Now we can access the varaibles by calling x(Dn) where x is the offset from Dn. So if we wanted to access the first variable in the scope, we woud use 0(Dn). <br><br> There are other variations of this process depending on where we are declaring our memory model from. For example, if we are creating a memory model for a function that has 3 parameters, we follow the same basic steps, but we need to make sure that we account for the extra space needed to store the parameters, the return value, and where we made a call to that function from. To accomodate for these extra values, we just add more to the stack pointer so we have room.</p>

<h2>Semantic Information</h2>
<p>In order to fully utilize the semantic analyzer, we need to gather certain information while we parse, and keep it around so we can make informed decisions when it comes to generating code. For example, when we are adding two values, we need to store the types of the values that we are trying to add together. An error will occur if we try to add different types in the virtual machine. So we store off the types of the expressions, and check if they are compatible before pushing them onto the stack. If they are different types, but can be converted (i.e float to int), we convert the latter into the former and push those onto the stack. If they can't be converted (i.e. string to boolean), then we throw an error.</p>

<h2>Sample Method for Code Generation</h2>
<h3>Parser Code</h3>
<p><pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">
  public static Boolean OptionalRelationalPart(String expressionType, int parameterNum, String name) throws Exception{
    Boolean returnVal = false;
    if(lookahead == "MP_EQUAL" || lookahead == "MP_GTHAN" || lookahead == "MP_LTHAN" || lookahead == "MP_LEQUAL" || lookahead == "MP_GEQUAL" || lookahead == "MP_NEQUAL"){
      String operator = RelationalOperator();
      String secondExpressionType = SimpleExpression(parameterNum, name);
      SymanticAnalyzer.computeExpression(expressionType, secondExpressionType, operator);
      returnVal = true;
    }else if(lookahead == "MP_DO" ||lookahead == "MP_DOWNTO" || lookahead == "MP_ELSE" ||lookahead == "MP_END"||lookahead == "MP_THEN" ||lookahead == "MP_TO" ||lookahead == "MP_UNTIL" ||lookahead == "MP_COMMA" ||lookahead == "MP_RPAREN" ||lookahead == "MP_SCOLON"){
      //epsilon
    }else{
      throw new Exception("Parse Error " + tokens.get(0).lineNumber + ":" + tokens.get(0).colNumber + ": Found " + lookahead + ", expected just about anything else");
    }
    return returnVal;
  }

</code></pre></p>

<h3>Symantic Analyzer Code</h3>
<p><pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">
  public static void computeExpression(String factorType, String factorTailType, String operator) throws Exception {
    // fixed acts the same as a float, so convert so we can compare
    if(factorType.equals("MP_FIXED")){ 
      factorType = "MP_FLOAT";
    }
    
    if(factorTailType.equals("MP_FIXED")){
      factorTailType = "MP_FLOAT";
    }
    
    // check for type compatibility
    if(factorType.equals(factorTailType)) {
      // do nothing
    } else if(factorType.equals("MP_FLOAT") && factorTailType.equals("MP_INTEGER")) {
      bw.write("CASTSF\n");
    } else if (factorType.equals("MP_INTEGER") && factorTailType.equals("MP_FLOAT")) {
      bw.write("CASTSI\n");
    } else {
      throw new Exception("incompatible types");
    }
    
    // add F to the instruction to deal with a float
    if(factorType.equals("MP_FLOAT")) {
      operator += "F";
    }
    
    bw.write(operator + "\n");
  }

</code></pre></p>
