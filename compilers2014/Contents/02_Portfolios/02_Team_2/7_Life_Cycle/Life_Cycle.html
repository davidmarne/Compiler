<h1>Life Cycle</h1>
<p>
The contributions from each of our team members were equally valuable to this project.  We did almost the whole project as a group. It probably would have been faster to split it up into multiple tasks, and then have each of us take one, but we decided it would be a better learning experience if we did the whole thing together. There were times where someone would work on it individually to clean up some bugs or improe an already built feature, but the majority of the work was done as a group. We also split up and did individual work towards the end when we started generating mico-code instructions. This work was a bit harder to follow as a group, and was easier if one person could just go heads down and crank it out.

This method worked well for us, because even though it took more time, we all formed a more solid knowledge of what it takes to build a compiler. We all got to touch every bit of code, and know how each component interacts with one another. Had this been a more professional environment, with a deadline, we would have taken a more agile approach, and cranked out the different peices of the compiler separately, but at a faster pace. We would have reviewed eachother for errors, but our level of understanding would be much lower had we not helped write each peice.
