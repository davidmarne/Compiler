<h1>Life Cycle</h1>
<p>
The contributions from each of our team members were equally valuable to this project.  
We used a handful of models throughout the development of our compiler.  
Parts of the project were helpful to do as a group, however, parts of the assignment were better to do on an individual basis.  
The initial skeleton of the Parser was beneficial to split into four parts and have each group member handle one part.  
Once we got the Parser outlined, we took on tasks such as the Symbol Table and Semantic Analyzer.  
These sections were much easier for one person to handle than try to split between the whole group.
</p>
<p>
At this point of our assignment, we took more of an agile approach to programming.  
We used Google Drive to start a backlog of both errors and things that needed to be added to the code.  
Each of us were able to remove things from and add things to the backlog as we had time to code.
